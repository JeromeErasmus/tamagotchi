# Tamagotchi Nodejs app
This project was fun! It brings back so many great memories I had as a kid of playing with Tamagotchi toys and keeping the little critters alive. This project was Built with Visual Studio Code.

### Installation
cd into the project root directory and issue the below commands:

```sh
$ npm install yarn (brew install yarn for osx)
$ yarn install
```

### Start the dev server
```sh
$ yarn dev
```
Then head over to localhost:8080

In development mode the Express backend (Node server) is running nodemon which auto restarts the server when server side changes are effected.
